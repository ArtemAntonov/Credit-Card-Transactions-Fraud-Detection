# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection
## Project Overview
  
As online transactions increase, so does the risk of fraud, making effective detection systems crucial for financial institutions.

In this project, we leverage various algorithms and data processing techniques to analyze transaction data and flag potential fraud. You will find detailed documentation on data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics to help you understand how these systems work in real-world applications.

## Data

This project uses **[Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data)** which contains generated credit card transactions made by 1000 cardholders. It comprises over 1.8 million trasnsactions. 

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.
- Model development: Implementation of various algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for classification.
- Model evaluation: Use of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for performance assessment.
- Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize models.

## Process
1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Preprocessing: Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE
3. Model training and testing
4. Evaluation and comparison of models
5. Conclusion
